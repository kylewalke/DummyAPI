# Spring Boot Dummy API Application 
This was made so we can mess around with an app easily So it doesn't include all of the extra
configurations we've added for security because this should 100% ONLY be run locally. 

To Run/Setup
1. Open project in VSCode and select DUMMY-API
2. Make any changes to the app in DummyAPI.java you might need to for testing
3. Click on the Spring Boot VSCode extension tab on the left.
4. Click on Run button in the SpringBoot Dashboard window under the APPS header 
    to start the specific application for testing.
